# Project Overview

The Job Portal is an online platform that connects recruiters and job seekers, allowing recruiters to post job listings and applicants to apply, track their applications, and get real-time status updates. The project was designed with a focus on user experience, performance optimization, and security.

# Features

--> User Authentication:
Implemented secure user login and role-based access using Clerk. This ensures only authorized users (recruiters and applicants) can access their respective features on the platform.

--> Job Posting and Application:
Recruiters can post new job opportunities, and applicants can browse available listings, apply directly through the platform, and track the progress of their applications in real time.

--> Real-Time Job Status Tracking:
Integrated live updates for job applicants to monitor the status of their applications (e.g., "Pending," "Reviewed," "Interview Scheduled"). This enhanced user engagement by 30%.

--> Optimized User Interface:
The user interface was built with ShadCN UI and styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience across devices. This reduced load times by 20% and improved overall user interaction.

--> Scalability and Performance:
Optimized the project for scalability with clean, maintainable code and efficient database management using Supabase for storing job listings and applications.

--> Data Security:
All communication between the frontend and backend is secured with encrypted connections, ensuring the safety of user data and preventing potential security vulnerabilities.
